    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. Efficient algorithms have lower time complexity, making them faster and more suitable for large datasets.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires to run to completion. It is often expressed in terms of O(n), where n is the size of the input.</p>
